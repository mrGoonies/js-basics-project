# About Repo

In this repo I will be creating different projects using Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS. The focus will be on prepare for Full Stack Developer Bootcamp, particularly on the JavaScript part. The projects will be simple and will not use any frameworks or libraries. The goal is to understand the core concepts of JavaScript and how to use them in real-world applications.

## Projects

1. **Passenger Counter**: A simple passenger counter that allows you to add and remove passengers from a list. The project uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a simple user interface. The project is a good example of how to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and create a simple user interface.
